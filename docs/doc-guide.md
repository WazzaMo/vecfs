# Doc Guide

Markdown is a text file format that should be as readable as a text file
and only made "nicer" to read when rendered as HTML or other manner.

# Principles

1. use heading levels 1 to 4 (#) to (####) and use level 1 for new sections,
not as the title.

2. space out the file, around headings and between paragraphs so that
the file does not get cluttered.

3. Use mermaid for images where they add value but put quotes (") around
all text labels so that non-alpha characters do not break the rendering.
