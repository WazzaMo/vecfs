# Doc Guide

Markdown is a text file format that should be as readable as a text file
and only made "nicer" to read when rendered as HTML or other manner.

# Principles

1. use heading levels 1 to 4 (#) to (####) and use level 1 for new sections,
not as the title.

2. space out the file, around headings and between paragraphs so that
the file does not get cluttered. Place an empty line after a heading.

3. Use mermaid for images where they add value but put quotes (") around
all text labels so that non-alpha characters do not break the rendering.

4. Do not use **highlight** to replace headings, use headings instead.

5. Try to format the table so it looks clear in the markdown text file.

6. Tables communicate better when a category or label is being described.

| Category | Description          |

| Note 1   | make it easy to read |
