# Summary

This release adds decision-aware memory behaviour to the vecfs-memory skill, clarifies documentation layout in the doc guide, and includes MCP server and plugin improvements.

## Skills

### vecfs-memory: decisions in memory and context sweep

The vecfs-memory skill (plugin and standalone) now treats project decisions as first-class memory.

#### When to activate

The skill activates when the conversation or a markdown file indicates that a decision has been made.

#### Storing decisions

Decisions detected in user-agent conversation or in markdown (e.g. "we decided to use X", "Decision: ...") are summarised and stored via the `memorize` tool with metadata such as `{"type": "decision"}`.

#### Context sweep

Stored decisions are discovered like other memories during a context sweep; agents incorporate recalled decisions into reasoning and mention them when they affect the current task.

Both `vecfs-plugin/skills/vecfs-memory/SKILL.md` and `vecfs-memory/SKILL.md` are aligned on this behaviour.

## MCP server

#### Vector input

The server now accepts vectors as either JSON objects or JSON strings, improving compatibility with callers that serialise parameters differently.

#### Feedback

Support for score adjustments (rankings) on feedback is included in this version.

## Plugin and installation

- Cursor plugin layout and marketplace metadata are in place under `vecfs-plugin/`, with the vecfs-memory skill bundled.
- Installation from GitHub is documented and supported via `install-from-github.sh`.

## Documentation

### Doc guide: purposeful markdown

The doc guide (`docs/doc-guide.md`) now defines where and how to use certain markdown artefacts:

#### Notes

Live in `docs/notes/`, prefixed with the date (YYYY-MM-DD) and a short topic name.

#### Release notes

Live in `docs/release-notes/`, with the naming convention `{semver}-Release-{date}.md`. They summarise significant changes in vecfs_embed, the MCP server, and skills for each release.

This release note follows that convention.
